<h1>Cats and Dogs</h1>

<p>The debate between whether cats or dogs are the superior pets is as old as time. I think it's important to keep in mind that they are both <strong>fluffy </strong> and <strong>adorable</strong> animals. So even if you prefer one over the other, remember it is your duty to pet them all, <em>as long as you are not allergic.</em>
