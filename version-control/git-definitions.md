# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  
  Version control is a method of keeping track of and implementing changes to a programs code. It's useful because it allows multiple people to work on different tasks for the same project without them having to worry about breaking the program because they'll always a working version.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  A branch is your copy of the main project you're working on. It's important to use branches because it allows you to make and test changes to ensure that they work properly before making those changes to the source code

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  A commit is a change you make to your local repo. A good commit message succinctly tells you what changes were made. It's important to keep in mind that others may need to read it so it should be clear enough for them to understand what was done. 


* What is a merge conflict?

  A merge conflict occurs when two people try to commit changes that they made to the same piece of code or if one person deletes a file that another person is modifying.
